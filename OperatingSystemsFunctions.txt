One operating system function is starting your computer. First the power supply sends electrical current to the circuitry in the computer which causes the processor chip to reset itself and finds the firmware that contains the startup instructions. The startup process executes tests to check components. Then the kernal of the operating system and other instructions load from the computers internal storage to its RAM. Last the operating system in memory takes control and loads system configuration information. 
Another OS function is to manage programs. Some are single tasking meaning that they allow only one program or application to run at a time. Others are multi tasking meaning that they allow two or more applications or programs to reside in memory at the same time. Most are multitasking.
